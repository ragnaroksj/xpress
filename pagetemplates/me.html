	<p>My name is Jun(Jim) Su. I am from Shanghai, China and now living in New York.</p>
	<br />
	<P>I am a frontend developer and love coding and design. I often use jQuery, underscore to operate the Dom and interactive operation. Require and Backbone help me to construct the JS framework in my project. Moreover, I also write some small applications. I love researching on the latest JS concept, JS pattern and apply them into my project and my personal website. Recently I am trying to integrate ajaxy to strengthen my ajax functionality. Additionally, I use Sass and Less for my different projects. I also try to use OOCSS to optimiaze my css files. I use r.js and grunt to compress my frontend files. I will continue learning because they are too many interesting stuff in the frontend world.</p>
